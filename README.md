# Craig Andera's emacs Setup

This repository contains my personal emacs setup. It is intended to be used with emacs 23 - previous versions may not work at all.

# Getting Started

This setup makes heavy use of git submodules, and it puts all my stuff
in ~/.emacs.d/custom to allow you to put your own customizations right
in ~/.emacs.d.

1. Clone this repository.
1. Run /path/to/this/repo/setup

That should do it!
